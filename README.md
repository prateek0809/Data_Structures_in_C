## Introduction

This repository showcases different data structures implemented in C and C++. The purpose of these implementations is to help understand and practice the fundamental concepts of data structures. The repository includes examples and explanations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Getting_Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prateek0809/Data_Structures_in_C_and_C++.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Data_Structures_in_C_and_C++
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Dev-C++**

   - Launch Dev-C++.
   - Go to File > Open and select the .c file or project file you want to work on.
   - Alternatively, you can create a new project and add the .c files to it.

4. **Compile the Code**

   - Click on Execute > Compile & Run or press F9 to compile and run your code in Dev-C++.

## Data_Structures

This repository contains implementations of the following data structures:

- **Arrays**: Basic arrays and their operations.
- **Linked Lists**: Single and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Stack operations and implementation.
- **Queues**: Queue operations including circular queues.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and other tree structures.
- **Graphs**: Basic graph implementations and algorithms.


## Usage
Refer to the individual directories for detailed usage instructions for each data structure implementation. Each directory contains sample programs and test cases.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
